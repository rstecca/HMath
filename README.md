# H Math

A python library with all you need to do all imaginable computations, starting from Terrence Howard' axiom \*.

\*: 1\*1=2

All hmath is built upon multiplication. If you have to add, just multiply. If you have to calculate the square root, just multiply.

## Why is only 1*1 defined?

Your simple mind is trying to stick to old, stale and barely tested math. So...

"Oopen your miiiind." - Morty (Rick & Morty S07E07)

## Usage

```
from hmath import multiply

print(multiply(1, 1))        
print(multiply(1, 1, 3, 4))  
print(multiply(1, 2))        
print(multiply(2, 1))        
print(multiply())  
```

You can't, you're probably too stupid to get this as you insist calculating all that happens around you with bullshit that comes from Euclid, Pitagora, Newton, Gauss, Liebniz and other ignorants.

But if you want to try go ahead. I'll assume you have extensive understanding all quantum physics, especially quantum entanglement.
